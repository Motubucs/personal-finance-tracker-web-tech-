# 🚀 Backend Deployment Guide

## Option 1: Railway (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Railway Account
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create new project

### Step 2: Deploy Backend
1. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Or drag the `finance-backend` folder to Railway

### Step 3: Add Database
1. In Railway, click "Add service" → "Database" → "MySQL"
2. Copy the connection details

### Step 4: Import Database
1. Use Railway's MySQL console or phpMyAdmin
2. Import the `personal_finance_tracker.sql` file

## Option 2: Quick Demo Mode (Fastest)

I can create a version with mock data that works immediately:

### Mock Data API
- ✅ No database required
- ✅ Works instantly on Netlify
- ✅ Perfect for demos
- ❌ Data doesn't persist

## Current Status:

Your site: `https://dynamic-entremet-97a5d7.netlify.app`
Backend needed at: `https://finance-tracker-production.up.railway.app`

## Next Steps:
1. **Deploy backend to Railway** (15 minutes)
2. **OR create mock version** (5 minutes)
3. **Update Netlify** with working version
